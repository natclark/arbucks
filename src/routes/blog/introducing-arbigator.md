I don't know about you, but I know that I certainly prefer having my price chart and trading widget side-by-side, rather than on different screens or pages.

Because Sushiswap is the only Arbitrum DEX fully supported by Arbucks so far, I recently added a Sushiswap embed directly next to charts on token pages.

This was a very well-recived feature, so I figured, why not take it one step further?

I wanted to create way to aggregate prices across multiple different DEXes with the following properties:

1. Support for all major Arbitrum DEXes

2. Fully open-source codebase

3. No intermediary contracts/routers

4. Full control over slippage, transaction timeouts, multihops, etc.

5. **No extra fees**

And that's why I've deided to build *Arbigator*!

It's still a work-in-progress, and it's very experimental.

But I look forward to hearing about all the features you want to see and all the bugs you encounter when using the widget.

My goal for Arbigator is for it to become a critical and high-quality feature that keeps users coming back to the site.

If you want to give it a try, just visit any [token page](/tokens/) using a desktop device. (Arbigator isn't supported on mobile devices just yet! Sorry for the inconvenience.)

Anyway, thanks for reading!
