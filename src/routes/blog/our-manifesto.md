While Ethereum's dominant long-term scaling solution may very well be zk-Rollups or something else, Arbitrum has a great shot at being the dominant L2 for the next few years at the very least.

And I expect Arbitrum's adoption to go absolutely ballistic this fall and coming winter.

This is absolutely *not* guaranteed - because cutting edge technology simply isn't always a walk in the park.

From the brief outage we've seen last Monday to the bridge withdrawal issues we've seen today, it is possible that more bugs may follow in the future.

However, I do have especial confidence in the general competency of the Offchain Labs team and am fairly certain that they are capable of adequately supporting this adoption.

We've seen what happened with Polygon, and we've seen what happened with Binance Smart Chain.

Arbitrum *could* be bigger than both of these networks while maintaing longer-term traction.

And that's something I'm very excited about (and have been very excited about for years).

And while I don't have any particular bias towards Arbitrum, or any other L2, I'm just trying to take the practical approach of building for whichever platform is most likely to succeed.

## The Arbucks Manifesto

Anyway, this is where Arbucks comes into play.

I wanted to solve a real problem for Arbitrum users instead of just copy-pasting some washed up DeFi protocol from a year ago or something like that.

So that's why I decided to create a platform for real-time price data, precise token information, a slick UI, and other features that give users a strong advantage.

*Now if you're reading this right after I post this article, you'll likely notice that my vision for this platform is very much a work in progress.*

*After all, data has been out of sync since last Monday's brief outage - although I am working tirelessly to resolve the issue.*

But I do have a lot in store for this platform and just want to provide Arbitrum users with the ability to take advantage of the ecosystem as much as they can.

The more of the research process I can automate, the better. For example, lots of time gets wasted trying to answer questions like these when researching new projects:

- *Is the liquidity locked?*

- *Is the token inflationary or fixed-supply?*

- *What is the market cap and volume?*

- *Where can I find more information about this project?*

And these are just a *few* examples.

The point is, I want to automate as much of the repetitive and menial steps of the gem-picking funnel as possible.

So the goal of this platform could really just be summed up as "Helping Arbitrum Users Make It".

After all, this community has been very supportive of my work thus far, and I really want to see those who are involved in the ecosystem and investing in these legitimate projects succeed.

## Conclusion

Meme coins are fun and all...

But the implications of a real L2 that even works just sufficiently is truly extraordinary.

Reducing the cost (and finality) of transactions enhances Ethereum's profound capability for creating automated protocols and efficiently incentivized human collaboration beyond our imagination.

*This of course assumes that decentralization and other key components of Ethereum are preserved or sacrificed with reasonable balance.*

But I really just want to connect traders with the L2-native projects that will actually fundamentally change the way the world works.

(And who knows, maybe [Arbidoge](/tokens/0x155f0dd04424939368972f4e1838687d6a831151/) *will* actually change the way the world works... ðŸ™ƒ)
