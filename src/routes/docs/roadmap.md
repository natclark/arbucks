# Roadmap

In *no particular order*, here are some of the bigger features that are coming up:

- Support for Uniswap pairs
- Support for MCDEX pairs
- Support for Swapr pairs
- Liquidity analytics
- Volume analytics
- Better color scheme
- Improved accessibility
- Improved internationalization
- Acquisition of `arbucks.com` (if possible)

Items from this list will silently come and go. It's sort of like a public to-do list.
