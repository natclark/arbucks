# Roadmap

In *no particular order*, here are some of the bigger features that are coming up:

- Support for Uniswap pairs
- Support for MCDEX pairs
- Liquidity analytics
- Volume analytics
- Improved recent transaction analytics
- Fully diluted market cap info
- Portfolio tracker
- Slicker, more modern UI
- Better color scheme
- Improved accessibility
- Improved internationalization
- Acquisition of `arbucks.com` (if possible)
- TradingView candlestick charts (not 100% guaranteed)

Items from this list will silently come and go. It's sort of like a public to-do list.
