# Frequently Asked Questions

Here's some of the questions that either get asked a lot on Telegram or are inevatible enough to make it worth providing an answer ahead of time.

## What is Arbucks?
Arbucks is an open-source charting and analytics web app for [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io)!

## Is there a token?
There will be! It's launching **this Saturday** at 10 PM UTC. See the [token page](/docs/token/) for details.

## Can I help out?
Anyone is welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request to the [project GitHub page](https://github.com/natclark/arbucks). If you want, you can share some relevant DRM-free artwork in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/arbuckscafe), and we might use it with your permission. Credit will be given!

## How decentralized is it?
It's by far more decentralized than any other publicly available Arbitrum charting app thus far, but still far from satisfactory. See the [decentralization page](/docs/decentralization/) for more details!

## What if this site shuts down?
There is no intention to shut this site down, and there are currently no known threats. Providers would be switched as soon as possible, and in the meantime, you'd have to build and run the code yourself.

## What if the developer disappears?
The developer has no intention to purposefully disapper. However, gradual measures of decentralization are being taken to ensure the community can "keep the ball rolling", such as the formation of the DAC.

## What if this domain gets deleted?
There is no known threat to this domain, but it could in theory get deleted, such as if the registrar decides that it violates some policy. In any case, this site just mirrors `arbucks.pages.dev`, so that can be considered a backup. However, if that doesn't work, you'll have to build and run the code yourself until a new domain is set up. This site will eventually be available on at least one blockchain domain.

## How can I report a bug or request a feature?
Currently, the [Telegram group](https://t.me/arbuckscafe) is the best place to drop your feedback. Please give the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap/) a quick check before you request a feature though!

## What if the Telegram group shuts down?
The community can create a new one, although there are absolutely no plans to shut the group down. Still, there are edge cases which highlight the importance of the DAC.

## What if I get banned from the Telegram group?
As of writing this, there haven't been any issues yet. But if you broke a rule, you'll have to create a new account. Otherwise, you'll have to trust the admin to not make bans that contradict the group rules or lose their account. This is the importance of the DAC, which will decentralize governance.

## When will the token launch?
September 11, 2021 @ 10 PM UTC.

## How can I be sure the smart contracts are safe?
When new smart contracts launch, such as the Arbucks token contract, a step-by-step walkthrough of the code will appear in this very documentation section. They'll be explained in mostly non-technical terms.

## What is the token symbol?
Token metadata, including name and symbol, will **not** be released until the launch, to prevent scammers from creating fake tokens that mimic the real one.

## How will I know which token is authentic?
https://token.arbucks.io will turn into a functioning redirect as soon as the token launches. The correct contract address will also be readily available on this website. Do not trust *any* other links, such as direct links to Sushiswap or Uniswap pairs. **Anyone can create a fake pair with the same name!**

## Where are you guys based?
As of writing this, there's just one developer and one advisor. Both currently reside in different parts of the United States.

## Does this have anything to do with Starbucks Coffee?
No.

## Is this project affiliated with Offchain Labs?
Technically not, no.

## Why can't you launch the token right this literal second?
