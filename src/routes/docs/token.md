# Token

Everything on this page is a *rough draft*.

Some details my be tweaked leading up to the launch.

We're on track to launch Saturday, Sept. 11, at 10 PM UTC (that's 6 PM EST).

**When the token launches, https://token.arbitrum.io will redirect to the initial Sushiswap pair.**

The token address is: [0xAFD871f684F21Ab9D7137608C71808f83D75e6fc](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xAFD871f684F21Ab9D7137608C71808f83D75e6fc).

The presale link is: https://dxsale.app/app/v3/defipresale?saleID=2&chain=Arbitrum.

## Launch schedule

1) There will be a presale from 8:30 PM UTC to 10 PM UTC on DxSale.

2) Liquidity from the presale will lock up at 10 PM UTC.

3) The token will be available for trading on Sushiswap at 10 PM UTC.

### Presale details

- 3 ETH softcap, 5 ETH hardcap

- 10,000,000 (10M) BUCK per 1 ETH

- 0.1 ETH minimum contribution, 0.3 ETH maxmimum contribution

- 100% immediately locked in initial Sushi LP

- 1 month cliff

## General tokenomics

### Supply details

The Arbucks token is not native to the Ethereum mainnet, though it can be bridged over. Instead, it is native to [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io).

There are 100,000,000 (100M) Arbucks tokens, and that supply is fixed, meaning no more Arbucks tokens can be minted in the future.

However, tokens can still be burned or sent to inactive wallets, effectively removing them from the circulating supply.

### Intrinsic value

Currently, we're still figuring out how much intrinsic utility we can tie to the coin without running into issues with American securities laws.

Ideally, each token would carry advertising revenue, but for now, tokens can just be used for governance in the DAO, which is being formed.

### Transaction taxes

There are **no** transaction taxes of any kind.

## Initial distribution

- 72.42%: Presale
  - 50%: Presale hardcap
  - 20%: Sushiswap listing
  - 2.42% DxSale Insurance + Platform Fee
- 17.58%: Developer wallet
- 8%: DAO treasury wallet
  - 5%: Treasury
  - 3%: Marketing
- 2%: Advisors
  - 1.8%: TBD
  - 0.2%: Anthony Acevedo (founder, ArbiCalls)

### Initial governance

Because this is a speedy release, the developer wallet, DAO treasury wallet, marketing wallet, and advisory wallet will all be controlled by the developer at first.

The developer will be airdropped these tokens via DxDrop *after* the presale. Most of these tokens plan to be vested (and *will& be vested, if DxLock allows it - otherwise, we'll figure out another way to vest the tokens).

All wallet addresses will be publicly available for transparency.

## Trading pairs

The token symbol is "BUCK".

The initial trading pair will be either BUCK / ETH or BUCK / WETH, but likely the former.

Future pairs are likely to be created, including Uniswap V3 pairs.

The pair will debut on Sushiswap at 4,000,000 (4M) BUCK per 1 ETH.

## Charts and analytics

Charts will be available on this very platform, as you'd expect!

## Important disclaimer

Please be careful! Don't be rushed or pressured into buying.

If you want to wait a week after the launch to buy the token, that's completely fine.

If there's someone trying to shill you hard on the token, they are **not** affiliated with the project's developer, and are likely just be trying to "pump their bags".

Please use discretion and don't buy more than what you can afford to lose!

### Legal stuff

This token should not be considered as a security.
