## General tokenomics

### Supply details

The Arbucks token is not native to the Ethereum mainnet, though it can be bridged over. Instead, it is native to [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io).

There are 100,000,000 (100M) Arbucks tokens, and that supply is fixed, meaning no more Arbucks tokens can be minted in the future.

However, tokens can still be burned or sent to inactive wallets, effectively removing them from the circulating supply.

### Intrinsic value

Currently, we're still figuring out how much intrinsic utility we can tie to the coin without running into issues with American securities laws.

Ideally, each token would carry advertising revenue, but for now, tokens can just be used for governance in the DAO, which is being formed.

### Transaction taxes

There are **no** transaction taxes of any kind.

The developer will be airdropped these tokens via DxDrop *after* the presale.
