# API

Arbucks offers a few free and permissionless services for simplified Arbitrum analytics.

While it would be a technical misnomer to consider the following services an API because it's really just a static site, the concept is no different.

## Charts

So far, the only service offered is a handy way to embed Arbucks charts on your website. **However, this service is temporarily unavailable as we transition our primary charts to TradingView charts.**

While it's appreviated if you link back to `arbucks.io`, it's certainly not required.

However, the chart will have an `arbucks.io` watermark (albeit fairly faint and non-distracting).
