# Arbucks Docs

Welcome to the *official* Arbucks docs!

This details all the important information about the project.

## What is Arbucks?

Here's the elevator pitch:

- Token-powered and DAC-governed, Arbucks is an **open-source**, **product-first**, and **community-led** Arbitrum project.

- This web app is for Arbitrum charting and analytics. Many more features are in the works!

- The ultimate goal for this site to be a focal point of the Arbitrum ecosystem, offering unbiased and real-time token information, pool lists, network analytics, Arbitrum tutorials, and more.

## Why does Arbucks exist?

Its creation was motivated by a few elements of the other existing Arbitrum charting solutions:

- None supported most (let alone all) token pairs.

- Many were lacking various key features, from chart manipulation to stablecoin-adjusted prices.

- None were open-source, and they all of them relied on a centralized, closed-source back-end server.

## How can I use it?

You can browse live [tokens](/tokens/) and [pools](/pools/), but you can search for a token using the search box.

If the token exists, you can select it and browse assorted metrics including the price chart, recent transactions, and 24-hour volume.

There's also a [portfolio](/portfolio/) where you can track your Arbitrum-based digital assets in real-time, and tons of other features on the way.

Have fun! And if you're confused about anything, just drop us a line on Telegram!
